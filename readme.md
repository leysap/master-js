# FILES
1. index.html: file in HTML. 
2. style.css: file in CSS. Appling colors and order in our proyect.
3. script.js: file in Javascript. We have the logic about our proyect.


## index.html
- Principal Page.
- we have three sections: a random photo, a random id and the last one, show all the information and press in a boton.

## style.css
- In this file we have the styles of the proyect.

## script.js
- The logic of the page. 
- We use the API UNSPLASH to get a photo and show it (render) in the HTML.
- We use async await (promises), functions, bucles , styles(css) and implement events (like mouseover,mouseout, click).
- We created a button which change the color of the background (like we did in class).
- Also a list of products (object: ID, Title and Body).
- We consult to CHAT GPT to resolve problems in the render and and in the logic of some functions.
